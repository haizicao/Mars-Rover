# Project2-Mars-Rover_Fall_2023-Group2
In this project, our goal is to guide the Mars rover to pass through the designed path points as accurately and quickly as possible and record the environmental data of each path point. Based on this, we will compare the data recorded by the Mars rover's onboard sensors with the data recorded by the additional DHT-11 sensors installed to evaluate the performance of the sensors. This project was conducted on flat ground, and I have divided it into three main parts. The first part is the preliminary preparation work for the project, the second part is the process of collecting experimental data for the project, and the third part is the analysis of the situation of the Mars rover passing through the path points. I have created a separate folder for each of these three parts, which contains relevant experimental processes and analyses for each part. All data is based on testing conducted by me and my partners in specific situations.

## Part 1 : Mars Rover Build
This folder includes assembly pictures of the hardware structure of the Mars rover and preliminary inspection photos of the Mars rover's avionics equipment.

## Part 2 : Data collection and analysis
This section includes the experimental process of this project, the collected experimental data, and a comparative analysis of the collected experimental data.

## Part 3 : Autonomous navigation through waypoint
This section includes the path design diagram of the Mars rover and an analysis of the situation through the path points. Here, we will summarize the possible causes of errors in the Mars rover and attach possible improvement ideas.

Below these three major folders are some individual files, such as our presentation for the second and third parts.
