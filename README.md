# Project2-Mars-Rover_Fall_2023-Group2
In this project, our goal is to guide the Mars rover to pass through the designed path points as accurately and quickly as possible and record the environmental data of each path point. Based on this, we will compare the data recorded by the Mars rover's onboard sensors with the data recorded by the additional DHT-11 sensors installed to evaluate the performance of the sensors. This project was conducted on flat ground, and I have divided it into three main parts. The first part is the preliminary preparation work for the project, the second part is the process of collecting experimental data for the project, and the third part is the analysis of the situation of the Mars rover passing through the path points. I have created a separate folder for each of these three parts, which contains relevant experimental processes and analyses for each part. All data is based on testing conducted by me and my partners in specific situations.
